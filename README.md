#This was a simple game made for a class project

#the goal of this game was to emulate a version of Pokemon battling with straightforward code
#this is not necessarily good code and there are likely many bugs but it is more proof of concept and abilities

#to play the game, download and run code, preferably in an IDE but the terminal should be possible
#this is a "couch co-op" as in it is played by two separate people on the same system, yet this is not a co-op game, this is meant to be a versus style match-up
